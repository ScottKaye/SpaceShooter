# Space Shooter
This is a game created for my Game Engineering Principles midterm assignment.

## Setup
If downloading the repo and running it doesn't work, you may not have SDL set up properly within Visual Studio.  This project uses:
- `SDL2 (base)`
- `SDL_TTF`
- `SDL_mixer`
- `SDL_image`

Make sure the include paths and libraries are set up in your build properties.

This project is also set up to use [Visual Leak Detector](https://vld.codeplex.com/) to find leaks.  It will run in Debug mode, with output appearing in VS's Output window.
